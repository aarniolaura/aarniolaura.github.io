## Command-line course
You should write a short overall introduction to the course and
one section for every week (for the final week, you can talk about 
Jekyll and Github Pages). Please use appropriate headers for each 
section. You should briefly describe the main content of each week 
and also briefly reflect on what you learned during the week 
(maybe 1-3 sentences for reflection). You need to include at least one 
list, image and table on the cmdline-course page.
